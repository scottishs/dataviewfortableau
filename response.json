LIGHTER PRECIPITATION THROUGH MIDNIGHT... ...ACCUMULATING SNOW, MIXED WITH FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET RETURNS OVERNIGHT... .The majority of the measurable precipitation has ended for most of Minnesota this afternoon. Some freezing rain, sleet and snow will occur in west central Wisconsin before tapering off to freezing drizzle or flurries by late afternoon. There will be a break in the precipitation for this evening before snow, sleet and freezing rain returns late tonight for southern and central Minnesota, as well as west central Wisconsin. Some light freezing drizzle or flurries are possible this evening, but the majority of the measurable precipitation will occur after midnight. By the time the snow ends Tuesday morning, the highest snowfall totals of 4 to 6 inches will occur along and northwest of a line from Montevideo to Cambridge Minnesota. Storm total snowfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches are expected southeast of that line. Winter Weather Advisories remain in effect for the entire coverage area through 12 PM CST Tuesday. ...WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CST TUESDAY... * WHAT...Light snow or flurries, mixed with freezing drizzle at times, will continue through midnight. Steadier snow, mixed with freezing drizzle or sleet will develop after midnight. The combination of sleet, snow and freezing drizzle will result in difficult travel conditions, including during the morning commute on Tuesday. Additional snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches with trace amounts of ice. * WHERE...Portions of northwest and west central Wisconsin and central, east central, south central and southwest Minnesota. * WHEN...Until noon CST Tuesday. * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Be prepared for reduced visibilities at times. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... A Winter Weather Advisory means that periods of snow, sleet or freezing rain will cause travel difficulties. Be prepared for slippery roads and limited visibilities, and use caution while driving.
